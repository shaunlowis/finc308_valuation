# finc308_valuation
In this repo, I wanted to show the use of Latex for clear and concise financial document formatting.

The goal of this financial report was to use various financial modeling techniques in order to value a real-world firm.

I had the great pleasure to work with Benjamin Davenport and Tom Morris, where the workload was:
